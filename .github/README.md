# qiwi.ddl-go
a Go program that converts [qiwi](https://qiwi.gg) links to DDL. <br>
this is likely to be continously updated due to the qiwi team changing the links over and over; <br>
i.e. spyderrock, texturepackguy, and now qiwi.lol

**Usage:** <br>
`qiwiddl.exe https://qiwi.gg/file/xxxxxxx` <br>
`qiwiddl.exe` prompts for a download link
